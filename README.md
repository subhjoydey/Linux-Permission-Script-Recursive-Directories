# Linux Permission Recreated on Recursive Directories

## Overview

This project recreates the Ubuntu Permission Algorithm using a Bash Shell Script. It accepts three arguments or accepts user inputs of UserID/Username, GroupID/Groupname and Complete path to search recreate the Linux Permissions on the current and all the recursive diretories.

## Pre-Requisites

### Taking Arguments

#### CLI Arguments

You can pass the Command Line Arguments wihle running the bash script from the command line as follows:-
* ./PermissionRecursive argument1 argument2 argument3

You can then call these arguments by $1 $2 and $3 from the bash scripts. These are all stored as array elements and can be called all together as $@. This allows you to check for the number of arguments passed while calling the bash script and we use this to accept incomplete arguments from CLI as user inputs instead.

#### User Input

You can also take user input from the Command Line as:-
* read -p 'Username/UID: ' arguments[0]

This will print Username/UID: on the CLI and ask for an input which will be stored in arguments array.

### Array Uses

Some of the main array knowledge in bash scripts required in this script is how to print the entire array at once and to print the number of array elements.

* ${#arguments[@]} - This prints the number of elements in the array. This allows you to check for array lengths.
* printf '%s\n' "${my_array[@]}" - This prints the whole aray in one line.

### Understanding File Columns in /etc

#### /etc/passwd 

* (Column 1) Username: It is used when user logs in. It should be between 1 and 32 characters in length.
* (Column 2) Password: An x character indicates that encrypted password is stored in /etc/shadow file. Please note that you                          need to use the passwd command to computes the hash of a password typed at the CLI or to store/update                        the hash of the password in /etc/shadow file.
* (Column 3) User ID (UID): Each user must be assigned a user ID (UID). UID 0 (zero) is reserved for root and UIDs 1-99 are                               reserved for other predefined accounts. Further UID 100-999 are reserved by system for                                       administrative and system accounts/groups.
* (Column 4) Group ID (GID): The primary group ID (stored in /etc/group file)
* (Column 5) User ID Info: The comment field. It allow you to add extra information about the users such as userâ€™s full name,                            phone number etc. This field use by finger command.
* (Column 6) Home directory: The absolute path to the directory the user will be in when they log in. If this directory does                              not exists then users directory becomes /
* (Column 7) Command/shell: The absolute path of a command or shell (/bin/bash). Typically, this is a shell. Please note that                             it does not have to be a shell.

#### /etc/group

* (Column 1) group_name: It is the name of group. If you run ls -l command, you will see this name printed in the group                                field.
* (Column 2) Password: Generally password is not used, hence it is empty/blank. It can store encrypted password. This is                            useful to implement privileged groups.
* (Column 3) Group ID (GID): Each user must be assigned a group ID. You can see this number in your /etc/passwd file.
* (Column 4) Group List: It is a list of user names of users who are members of the group. The user names, must be separated by commas.

## Scripts

### checkr.bash

#### Overview

This  shell script accepts username/uid, groupname/gid and an absolute path as argument and then checks for the validity of the arguments. First we combine /etc/group and /etc/passwd into a single file sorted individually as "password" "group" into "credentials.txt". This file was then used to search for the user and group. For success of user,group we print appropriate string in file "result.txt".

#### User/Group/Path Check

* UserID/Username - We check the Username/UserID in the files /etc/passwd and /etc/group to verify if it is valid.
* GroupIF/Groupname - We check the Groupname/GroupID in the files /etc/passwd and /etc/group to verify if it is valid. This                         is done in two steps. (1) we check if the groupname/groupID exists (2) we check if the username is a                         part of the group. 
* Absolute Path - We check if the path exists. This is done by [test -d "$path"] . Where $path is a variable which holds the                   absolute path that is passed via arguments.
